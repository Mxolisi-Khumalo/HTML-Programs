        <p>
        Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are
        over <strong>3,000 years old</strong> and still perfectly edible! This is
        because honey has natural preservatives such as
        <u>low moisture content</u> and <u>high acidity</u>, which create an
        environment hostile to bacteria and microorganisms. So,
        <em>if you ever find yourself with a jar of honey</em> that's been sitting
        in your pantry for years, <em>it's still safe to eat</em>!
